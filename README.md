Muscle Tear Recovery Prediction

🚀 Health-Tech and AI Hackathon - IIT BHU (Spirit '25)

This project is developed as part of the Health-Tech and AI Hackathon hosted by IIT BHU during Spirit '25. The aim of this hackathon is to develop a prototype addressing health tech challenges using AI-driven solutions.

📌 Project Overview

Muscle injuries are common among athletes and individuals engaging in physical activities. This project utilizes machine learning models to predict the estimated recovery time for muscle tear injuries based on various factors such as age, severity, pain level, inflammation, treatment type, and more. The solution provides a user-friendly GUI for easy input and output visualization.

🎯 Features

✅ Predict Recovery Time: Estimates the time required for recovery based on input factors.✅ Machine Learning Models: Implements Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and XGBoost for accurate predictions.✅ Data Preprocessing: Cleans and structures data to enhance model performance.✅ Interactive GUI: Built using Tkinter for seamless user interaction.✅ Well-Documented Code: Ensuring clarity and ease of understanding for developers.
